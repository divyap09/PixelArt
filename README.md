PixelArt is a n x n matrix where the user can fill each pixel (box) with a color.

The main idea behind developing is, whenever I used to feel stressed I used to create a matrix and fill the pen color on a paper. Since everything is now getting digitalized I thought it would be fun to create a UI for this.

Current features:
1. able to generate a matrix dynamically with fixed size
2. by default only black color can be used
3. able to save (download) the art
4. allow multiple colors
5. undo and redo buttons for ease of use

Future updates:
1. responsive layout for different screens
