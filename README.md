PixelArt is a n x n matrix where the user can fill each pixel (box) with a color.

The main idea behind developing is, whenever I used to feel stressed I used to create a matrix and fill the pen color on a paper. Since everything is now getting digitalized I thought it would be fun to create a UI for this.

Current features:
1. able to generate a matrix dynamically with fixed size
2. by default only black color can be used

Future updates:
1. allow multiple colors
2. undo and redo buttons for ease of use
3. able to save (download) the art
